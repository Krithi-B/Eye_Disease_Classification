AI Project on Image Classification

ABSTRACT

Eye diseases are a significant global health concern, affecting millions of individuals and leading to vision impairment and blindness. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management. The CNN model was trained on a diverse dataset of retinal images, employing data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization and robustness. This project presents the development of CNN model for the detection of eye diseases along with detecting normal eye condition too.The model achieved an accuracy of 80%, making it a promising tool for aiding early diagnosis and supporting healthcare professionals. We implemented a comprehensive methodology that includes image pre-processing, model architecture design, and rigorous evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model employs advanced techniques such as ReLU activation, batch normalization, and the Adam optimizer with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.

OBJECTIVE:

1. Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify three prevalent eye diseases.
2. Achieve high classification accuracy (targeting 80% or above) to ensure clinical applicability and reliable diagnosis support.
3. Enhance the model's generalization and robustness through data augmentation techniques.
4. Use advanced CNN techniques like batch normalization, and the Adam optimizer for optimized model performance.
5. Evaluate the model’s performance using comprehensive metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 6. Support healthcare professionals by providing a tool that can assist in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.
